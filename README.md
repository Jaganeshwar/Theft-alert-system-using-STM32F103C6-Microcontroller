# Theft-alert-system-using-STM32F103C6-Microcontroller

  This project detects motion using the PIR sensor and triggers an alert via SMS through the GSM module when unauthorized movement is detected. The STM32F103C6 microcontroller processes sensor data and controls the GSM module. Upon detecting motion, the system sends a notification to predefined phone numbers, providing real-time alerts. This setup can be used for home security, warehouses, or other applications requiring motion detection and remote alerts. The system's reliability and efficiency make it suitable for various security needs.
